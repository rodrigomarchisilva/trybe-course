<h2 align=center>Summaries and exercises from Trybe's web development course</h2>

### **What this is all about**

* I made it as a reference for myself and others who wish to use it;
* It's meant to be used as a reference while coding with `VS Code`;
* I recommend you to use the VS Code's extension `Markdown Preview Github Styling`;
* While in `VS Code`, simply open the file you want and press `Ctrl+Shift+V`;
* All summaries are in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/);
* It has a few exercises in [Python](https://www.python.org/).
